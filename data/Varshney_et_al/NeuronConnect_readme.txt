- N1: Neuron 1 name
- N2: Neuron 2 name
- Type: Type of synapse: 
    - S: Send or output (Neuron 1 pre-synaptic to Neuron 2); 
    - Sp: Send-poly (Neuron 1 is pre-synaptic to more than one postsynaptic partner.  Neuron 2 is just one of these post-synaptic neurons, see Figure 1 below.  In White et al, 1986, these polyadic synaptic connections were denoted by “m” in the tables of Appendix 1); 
    - R: Receive or input (Neuron 1 is post-synaptic to Neuron 2); 
    - Rp: Receive-poly (Neuron 1 is one of several post-synaptic partners of Neuron 2.  See Figure 1 and above); 
    - EJ: Electric junction; 
    - NMJ: Neuromuscular junction (only reconstructed NMJ's are represented). 

    - It must be noted that at polyadic synaptic sites, not all “send-poly” were faithfully labeled as such in White et al, 1986. 
    - Some pre-synaptic connections were labeled simply as “sends”. 
    - Reconciliation of chemical synapses did not previously distinguish between send from send-poly and receive from receive-poly. 

    - In this new reconciliation, the total number of send and send-poly is equal to the total number of receive and receive-poly (S+Sp=R+Rp).

    - Every documented synapse is now listed in this Table, both with respect to the sending neuron and with respect to the receiving neuron(s).

- Nbr: Number of synapses between the given neuron pair.
